What:
This is a personal project I'm currently working on. The objective of this project is to create from scratch various data structures and algorithms I've learned in my Java II
course. It currently incorporates
-Arraylist
-Linkedlist
-BinaryTree
-Heap
-Hash
-Insertion sort
-Merge sort
and is all wrapped into a GUI. The GUI gave me something to apply the data structures too, and also helped me practice Object Oriented design. The GUI classes demonstrate my
understanding of inheritence, and encapsulation.
